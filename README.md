## Contributions

Feel welcome to open issues and PRs, fix things related to type safety, [documentation](http://github.com/babakfp/babakfp.ir), send suggestions, improve code, etc. It's OK to make mistakes and not to know everything.

## Todo

-   [ ] Add `mdsvex` to `svelte-in-markdown` guide.

## Note

-   We're not directly using the package called `"vfile"`, but it's automatically helping out by providing types.
