# Svelte in Markdown

## Todo

-   [ ] Add lots of JSDoc comments.
-   [ ] A Prettier plugin for Svelte inside Markdown.
-   [ ] Should the `declarationMap` option be set to `true` in `tsconfig.json`.
-   [ ] Add `mdsvex` to `svelte-in-markdown` guide.

## Note

-   Currently, you can't use `<script context="module"` in markdown files. If you need this feature, just let me know, and I'll fix it.
-   We're not directly using the package called `"vfile"`, but it's automatically helping out by providing types.
